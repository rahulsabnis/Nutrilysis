# IEEE-Quarterly-Project
The inspiration comes from people’s unawareness of environment and people’s awareness of health. Every person can influence the environment based on the choice they make, even what kind of food they choose. So we want to create a website, maybe a mobile app if we have enough time, so that people can input what they eat for every meal every day (maybe by uploading photos, but it would be difficult to realize this). For example, people may eat pasta or pizza. And the website will show how the environment is impacted by what we eat. For example, how much water was consumed to produce what we eat in one day or how much CO2 was emitted during the production. By visualizing the direct impact, people may be more aware of their behaviors such as eating habits. Also, the website can show how much calories people intake per day. In addition to this, people can input how much they exercised during the day such as the miles they walked or the calories they spent in the gym. And then we can maybe even predict the weight change during a day. As for the hardware, we can add LED lights or buzzers corresponding to the calories or the water consumption. Overall, we are going to create a website that takes user input of different kinds of food they have and how much they exercised and outputs the statistics about calories and environmental impact. By doing this , people will be more aware of what they are eating.
